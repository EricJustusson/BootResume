BootRésumé
==========

What is BootRésumé?
-------------------
BootRésumé turns your long winded, bullet heavy resume into a stremalined static webpage, highlighting your skills & accomplishments. All the assets are pulled via CDN, so everything is lightweight too. 

Because BR is built on Bootstrap, you can modify anything you want with a few comments, and it's mobile-ready out of the box!

How to use BootRésumé
---------------------
Check out the <a href="http://nealrs.github.io/BootResume">live demo</a> to see BR in action and then fork this repo to get the template. Add line items for additional information, and comment out what you don't need

FYI, you can see my BootRésumé <a href = "http://nealshyam.com">right here</a>.
